*Trompeloeil* is a popular statically typed mocking framework for C++14 and
later¹. Unlike other C++ mocking frame works, it uses RAII to achieve well
defined ends for when an expectation must at the latest be met, and allows
natural expression syntax for actions, filtering of expectations, side effects
and return values.

*Trompeloeil* was created by
[Björn Fahller](https://github.com/rollbear) in 2014, and has
since received support from numerous contributors, most significantly from
[Andrew Paxie](https://github.com/AndrewPaxie), who in 2018 became a full
project collaborator.

¹ C++11 is mostly supported, with a few exceptions, and with a less convenient
syntax.

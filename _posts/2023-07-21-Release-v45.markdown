title: Release v45
---

v45 generalizes regex matchinng support, so that types like
[`std::string_view`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view)
can be used. Get it
[here](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/releases/tag/v45).

* Fixed issue [304](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/issues/304):
  `regex` matcher could only match regular expressions against `const char*` and
  [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string).

* Added adapter for
  [QA Systems Cantata](https://www.qa-systems.com/tools/cantata/) unit test
  framework. Thank you, Andreas Sch√§tti for the contribution.

* Added `static_assert` to `duck_typed_matcher`'s templatized conversion
  function explaining why it should never be instantiated. Issue

* Added gcc-12 and clang++-15 to the CI build matrix

* Fixed issue [272](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/issues/272): Support
  *Catch2* piecemeal headers.

* Fix issue [279](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/issues/279) where the
  *doctest* adapter showed violation messages as hex addresses for most recent
  releases of *doctest*. Thanks  SimonKagstrom for reporting.

* Fixed an obscure bug where an expectation could match with a sequence object
  that has run to completion.

* Specify `ARCH_INDEPENDENT` when creating package version file in *CMake*.

title: v48 with COM
---

v48 brings fixups and support for COM by allowing mocks for STDMETHOD
functions.

* Fixed memory leak when adding an action (.RETURN, .SIDE_EFFECT, etc)
  throws. Thank you Dominic Koepke for the fix.

* Dropped older compilers from CI builds (gcc <= 6 and clang <= 7) since
  GitHub actions now require node-20, and no build environment is
	  currently available that both supports node-20 and older compilers.

* Support for STDMETHOD functions for COM. Thank you Luis Andres Cesena
  for the implementation, and Kevin Puetz for the discussions. This
  adds new macros:

      MAKE_STDMETHOD_MOCKn(...)
      IMPLEMENT_STDMETHOD_MOCKn(...)

* Fixed issue with std::expected causing compilation error. Thank you
  @subbota-a for reporting

* Silenced gcc -Weffc++ warnings. Thanks Sven Fischer for the report

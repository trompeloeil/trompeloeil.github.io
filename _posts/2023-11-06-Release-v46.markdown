title: v46 with coroutines and fixes
---

v46 implements experimental support for coroutines and fixes output for
input-range like types

* Experimental support for coroutines. Use `CO_RETURN` (or `LR_CO_RETURN`)
  for a member function that has a coroutine return type. Use `CO_THROW`
  (or `LR_CO_THROW`) to throw from a coroutine. Use as many `CO_YIELD`
  (or `LR_CO_YIELD`) from a coroutine function as you like, as long as the
  promise type supports it.

  The experimental support must be explicitly enabled with
  
  ```C++
    #define TROMPELOEIL_EXPERIMENTAL_COROUTINES
    #include <trompeloeil.hpp>
  ```
  
  `trompeloeil::stream_tracer` does not produce correct result for coroutines

* Corrected output of input-range like types. Thank you Dominic Koepke for
  the fix.

* The self test program "custom_recursive_mutex" now says that it's
  succeeded. Thank you @yurivict for reporting the confusion.

* Self test programs are only build when explicitly setting
  `-DTROMPELOEIL_BUILD_TESTS=yes` to the CMake command line.

* The self test programs require a higher version of CMake (3.19 currently)

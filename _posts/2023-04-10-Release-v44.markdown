title: Release v44
---

v44 mostly improves messages and tool support. Get it
[here](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/releases/tag/v44).

* Fixed issue [293](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/issues/293):
  Wildcard `_` could not match types that can be
  constructed from any type. This fix unfortunately turns off conversion
  warnings for `REQUIRE_CALL` and friends when building with `gcc`. Thank
  you @TimonNoethlichs for reporting.

* Fixed issue [296](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil/issues/296):
  Improved sequence violation message when `ALLOW_CALL`
  is involved. Thank you Sigurður Sveinn Halldórsson for reporting.

* Fixed `-Wunsafe-buffer-usage` warning from `clang-16`

* `static_assert()` when trying to get a runtime value from any matcher

* Bumped required CMake version to 3.14 or later. Thank you Luke Dennis
  for reporting.
